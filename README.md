# SwordFinder ⚔️

A sophisticated Flask API that leverages MLB Statcast data to analyze and score baseball "sword swings" using advanced computational techniques and custom algorithms.

## Overview

SwordFinder identifies and analyzes the most impressive baseball swings that result in swinging strikes - these are called "sword swings" because the batter "swings and misses" at difficult pitches. The system uses authentic MLB Statcast data to find, score, and rank the top sword swings with comprehensive analysis including percentile rankings, expert AI commentary, and video highlights.

## Key Features

- **Authentic MLB Data**: Uses 226,833+ real Statcast records from official MLB sources
- **Advanced Filtering**: Identifies sword swings using multiple swing mechanics criteria
- **Custom Scoring Algorithm**: Proprietary weighted formula scoring swings 50-100 points
- **Percentile Analysis**: Compares each swing against entire season's data
- **AI Expert Commentary**: Claude-powered analysis of what makes each swing special
- **Video Integration**: Direct links to Baseball Savant video highlights and embedded MP4s.
- **Database Caching**: PostgreSQL storage for fast response times.
- **Live Patch System**: Browser-based tool to update missing data.
- **Dynamic Dashboards**:
    - Top 5 Swords by selected date.
    - Top 5 Swords of 2025 (All-Time) displayed on the main page, ranked by `raw_sword_metric`.

## Technical Architecture

### Backend Stack

### Data Sources
- **MLB Statcast**: Official pitch-by-pitch data via pybaseball
- **Baseball Savant**: Video highlights and play details
- **MLB Stats API**: Game data and player information

### Core Components

#### 1. Sword Swing Detection Engine
**File**: `simple_db_swordfinder.py`

**Critical Rule**: A true sword swing is the **final pitch of an at-bat that results in a strikeout**, where that final pitch is a `swinging_strike` or `swinging_strike_blocked`.

**Filtering Criteria (Conceptual - implemented in Python after SQL fetch):**
- **Bat Speed**: Preferably less than 60 mph (slower swings indicate difficulty).
- **Intercept Y**: Preferably greater than 14 inches (swing path intersection).
- **Swing Path Tilt**: Preferably greater than 30 degrees (steep swing angle).
- **Zone Penalty**: Dynamically calculated based on pitch location relative to strike zone.

**Query Logic (in `simple_db_swordfinder.py`):**
1.  A CTE (`final_pitches_of_strikeout_at_bats`) uses `DISTINCT ON (game_pk, at_bat_number)` and `ORDER BY ... pitch_number DESC` to select the *last recorded pitch* of all at-bats on a given date where `events = 'strikeout'`.
2.  The main query then selects from this CTE, further filtering these last pitches for `description IN ('swinging_strike', 'swinging_strike_blocked')`.
3.  It also ensures `bat_speed`, `swing_path_tilt`, and `intercept_ball_minus_batter_pos_y_inches` (aliased as `intercept_y`) are `NOT NULL`.
4.  All such candidates are returned to Python.

**Scoring Logic (in `simple_db_swordfinder.py`):**
1.  **Dynamic Zone Penalty Factor:** Calculated for each candidate based on `plate_x`, `plate_z`, `sz_top`, `sz_bot`. A factor >= 1.0 (1.0 is neutral, >1.0 rewards pitches further from the zone).
    ```python
    # Simplified concept from _calculate_dynamic_zone_penalty:
    out_x_feet = max(abs(plate_x) - 0.83, 0)
    # ... calculation for out_z_feet ...
    penalty_inches = (out_x_feet + out_z_feet) * 12
    scaled_bonus = min(penalty_inches / 18.0, 2.0) 
    dynamic_zone_penalty_factor = 1.0 + scaled_bonus
    ```
2.  **Raw Sword Metric:** Calculated for each candidate:
    ```python
    # Components are normalized (0-1 range, higher is "better" for a sword)
    bat_speed_comp = (60 - bat_speed) / 60 # if bat_speed <= 60 else 0
    tilt_comp = swing_path_tilt / 60 # if swing_path_tilt <= 60 else 1.0
    intercept_comp = intercept_y / 50 # if intercept_y <= 50 else 1.0

    raw_sword_metric = (
        0.35 * bat_speed_comp +
        0.25 * tilt_comp +
        0.25 * intercept_comp +
        0.15 * dynamic_zone_penalty_factor 
    )
    ```
3.  **Sorting:** All candidates are sorted by `raw_sword_metric` in descending order.
4.  **Final Scores for Top 5:**
    *   `sword_score` (Universal Scale): `raw_sword_metric * 50 + 50`
    *   `daily_normalized_score` (Daily UX Scale): Min-max normalized against all of the day's `raw_sword_metric` values, then scaled `50 + normalized_value * 50`.
    *   Both scores, plus `raw_sword_metric`, are included in the API response for the top 5 swords.

#### 2. Database Schema
**File**: `models_complete.py`

**Primary Table**: `statcast_pitches`
- 118+ fields covering all MLB Statcast data
- Optimized indexes on game_date, player_name, pitch_type
- Complete pitch details: velocity, spin rate, location, teams

**Note on Player Names and IDs**:
- **Pitcher Name**: For each pitch event, the pitcher's name is sourced from the `player_name` field in the `statcast_pitches` table. The `pitcher` field contains the pitcher's MLBAM ID.
- **Batter Name**: The batter's name is not directly available in the `statcast_pitches` table for each pitch. It is fetched dynamically by the application (`simple_db_swordfinder.py`) using the `batter` field (batter's MLBAM ID) to query the MLB Stats API (`https://statsapi.mlb.com/api/v1/people/{batter_id}`).
- **Pitch Name**: This refers to the descriptive name of the pitch type (e.g., "4-Seam Fastball") and is sourced from the `pitch_name` field in `statcast_pitches`. The `pitch_type` field contains the code (e.g., "FF").

**Analysis Table**: `sword_swings`
- Sword score calculations and rankings
- Percentile analysis results
- AI expert commentary
- Video URLs and local MP4 storage
- Cached results for performance

**Tracking Table**: `daily_results`
- Processing status by date
- Performance metrics and completion tracking

#### 3. Percentile Analysis Engine
**File**: `percentile_analyzer.py`

Compares each sword swing against season-wide data:
- **Bat Speed Percentile**: How slow compared to all swings
- **Swing Tilt Percentile**: How steep the swing angle
- **Velocity Percentile**: How fast the pitch was
- **Spin Rate Percentile**: How much the ball spun
- **Location Percentile**: Where in strike zone

#### 4. Expert AI Analysis
**Integration**: Claude Sonnet 4.0 via Anthropic API

Generates detailed commentary explaining:
- What made the swing technically difficult
- Pitch characteristics that created the challenge
- Swing mechanics analysis
- Context within the at-bat situation

## Recent Updates (May 26, 2025)

### 1. Fixed Sword Query Logic
- **Issue**: Query was returning no results due to overly restrictive filters
- **Solution**: Modified query to use CTE (Common Table Expression) to first identify strikeout at-bats, then find swinging strikes within those at-bats
- **Files Modified**: `simple_db_swordfinder.py`

### 2. Database Field Mapping Corrections & Batter Name Lookup
- **Issue**: Original field index mappings were incorrect in `simple_db_swordfinder.py`, leading to data misalignment (e.g., descriptive pitch names appearing in `batter_id` field, `pfx_z` values in `pitch_name` field). Batter names were also not being displayed.
- **Solution**:
    - Corrected field index mappings in `simple_db_swordfinder.py` to accurately reflect the SQL query's column order.
    - Implemented dynamic fetching of batter names using the `batter` ID (MLBAM ID) and the MLB Stats API (`https://statsapi.mlb.com/api/v1/people/{batter_id}`).
- **Current Status**: API now correctly returns sword swings with proper field values, including pitcher names, fetched batter names, and correct descriptive pitch names.
- **Note on `launch_angle` and `launch_speed`**: These fields will typically be `null` for sword swings (which are swinging strikes) because no ball is put into play. This is expected behavior and not a mapping error.

### 3. Diagnostic Tools Created
- **test_query.py**: Diagnostic script to check database contents and validate queries
- **debug_swords.py**: Comprehensive debugging tool for sword swing detection
- **Purpose**: Help identify why queries return empty results and validate data presence

### 4. Validated Data Presence
- **Confirmed**: Database has 4,650 pitches for May 24, 2025
- **Swinging Strikes**: 470 total swinging strikes on that date
- **With Bat Speed Data**: 468 swinging strikes have bat speed data
- **In Strikeout At-Bats**: 287 swinging strikes are part of strikeout at-bats
