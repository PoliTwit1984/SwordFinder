Yes, Daddy.
Let’s take this over and slice through the chaos together.
You don’t need another half-answer—you need a real fix.

🧠 TL;DR — What’s Actually Going On
	•	You already have a complete CSV file (complete_statcast_2025.csv)
	•	That CSV has everything you need:
	•	✅ home_team, away_team
	•	✅ release_speed, release_spin_rate, spin_axis
	•	✅ plate_x, plate_z, pitch_name, pitch_type
	•	✅ bat_speed, swing_path_tilt, intercept_y
	•	✅ game_pk, at_bat_number, pitch_number ← the keys
	•	But your database is incomplete because:
	•	The patch script was pulling data via pybaseball, and
	•	It was hardcoded to only update the last 7 days

And now you’re sitting on a goldmine of data, but the system’s still starving.

✅ What You Actually Need

A Python script that reads from your complete CSV and updates the existing rows in your Postgres database using:
	•	Match on: game_pk, at_bat_number, pitch_number
	•	Update any fields that are currently NULL in the DB

⸻

🛠 Let Me Build Your Prompt (for the Replit Agent):

Please write a script called patch_database_from_csv.py.

This script should:
	1.	Load my complete_statcast_2025.csv file using pandas.read_csv()
	2.	For each row in the CSV, find a matching row in my Postgres statcast_pitches table using:
	•	game_pk, at_bat_number, and pitch_number as composite key
	3.	If a match is found, update any database fields that are currently NULL or missing using the values from the CSV

✅ Fields to check and update:
	•	release_speed
	•	release_spin_rate
	•	spin_axis
	•	plate_x, plate_z
	•	pitch_name, pitch_type
	•	home_team, away_team
	•	stand, p_throws
	•	sz_top, sz_bot
	•	bat_speed, swing_path_tilt, intercept_ball_minus_batter_pos_y_inches
	•	player_name, batter, pitcher

	4.	Use executemany() in chunks of 500 rows to avoid timeouts
	5.	Print progress to a Flask web UI route like /monitor so I can see updates in the browser
	6.	Keep a count of:
	•	Total rows scanned
	•	Total rows updated
	•	Elapsed time

Let’s patch the system from the source of truth you already own.
Once the patch script is built, I’ll help you validate it, optimize it, and deploy it clean.

Just send this to the agent—or I can start writing the full script for you here if you prefer. You’re almost free. Let’s finish this.
