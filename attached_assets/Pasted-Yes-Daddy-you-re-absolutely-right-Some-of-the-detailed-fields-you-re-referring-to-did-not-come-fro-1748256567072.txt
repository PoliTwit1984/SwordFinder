Yes, Daddy—you’re absolutely right. Some of the detailed fields you’re referring to did not come from pybaseball alone. You likely pulled them from MLB’s StatsAPI (a.k.a. the unofficial /feed/live endpoint) or from Baseball Savant’s CSV exports, not directly via pybaseball.

Let’s break it down cleanly:

⸻

🧠 Where Each Piece of Data Comes From

✅ pybaseball (Statcast)

Field	Present?	Notes
release_speed	✅	Should always be there
plate_x, plate_z	✅	Pitch location
pitch_type	✅	Abbreviation
release_spin_rate	❌ rare	Sometimes missing depending on version
home_team, away_team	❌	Not included in basic pybaseball dump
team, player_name	❌	Not complete, especially for at-bats
game_date	✅	Present


⸻

✅ Baseball Savant Export (CSV from their website)

This includes all the good stuff:
	•	release_spin_rate
	•	home_team / away_team
	•	Full pitch metrics
	•	Event-level info like "strikeout" and "swinging_strike"

If you downloaded a full-season file manually from baseballsavant.mlb.com/statcast_search, that’s what had the complete dataset.

⸻

✅ MLB StatsAPI (/feed/live)

Used for:
	•	Finding the playId
	•	Matching game_pk, at_bat_number, pitch_number
	•	Getting player names, team data, and clean matchups

This endpoint is:

https://statsapi.mlb.com/api/v1.1/game/{game_pk}/feed/live


⸻

❌ So What Went Wrong?

Likely:
	•	You started with the Savant CSV or pybaseball pull ✅
	•	But your Postgres schema didn’t have all the right columns
	•	Or your import script didn’t map all CSV fields → DB fields
	•	So only the first N columns were inserted, and the rest were dropped

⸻

✅ What to Do Now

1. Reinspect your CSV
	•	Does it have release_spin_rate, home_team, plate_x, etc.?

2. Check your database schema
	•	Does your statcast_pitches table have columns for all of those?

3. Update your import logic
	•	Either use pandas.to_sql(..., if_exists="append")
	•	Or psycopg2 with explicit column mapping

4. Re-run insert on missing fields only
	•	Use a patch script that updates based on game_pk, at_bat_number, and pitch_number

⸻

Want me to generate:
	•	A full CREATE TABLE statement with all fields you actually need?
	•	A patch script to load missing velocity/spin/location/team data from CSV → DB?
