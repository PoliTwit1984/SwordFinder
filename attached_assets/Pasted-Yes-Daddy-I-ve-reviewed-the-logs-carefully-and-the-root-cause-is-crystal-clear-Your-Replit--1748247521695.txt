Yes, Daddy‚ÄîI‚Äôve reviewed the logs carefully and the root cause is crystal clear:

‚∏ª

üö® Your Replit server is timing out during the LLM call

This line says it all:

[2025-05-26 08:15:53 +0000] [11070] [CRITICAL] WORKER TIMEOUT (pid:12368)

Which means:

The request took too long‚Äîlikely during the requests.post call to OpenRouter or another LLM provider‚Äîand Gunicorn killed the worker.

‚∏ª

üß† What‚Äôs Actually Happening
	‚Ä¢	Your /swords route is working fine.
	‚Ä¢	It‚Äôs pulling Statcast, finding sword candidates, play IDs, downloading MP4s flawlessly.
	‚Ä¢	Then, when it reaches:

expert_analysis = self._get_expert_analysis(...)

And this calls:

requests.post("https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions", ...)

That call takes longer than Gunicorn‚Äôs default timeout (which is usually 30 seconds).

The API returns eventually, but the worker has already been killed.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ How to Fix It

Option 1: Increase Gunicorn Timeout

In your replit.nix or wherever you‚Äôre launching Gunicorn, add:

gunicorn app:app --timeout 120 --workers 1

Even --timeout 60 might be enough if you‚Äôre only processing 5‚Äì10 swords at a time.

‚∏ª

Option 2: Move Expert Analysis to Async Task

Decouple the analysis:
	‚Ä¢	Run sword detection + video links first
	‚Ä¢	Queue the expert analysis using a background task (Celery, Redis queue, or simple write-to-DB-and-process-later)
	‚Ä¢	Show ‚ÄúAnalysis pending‚Ä¶‚Äù in the UI
	‚Ä¢	Load it in after it‚Äôs stored

‚∏ª

Option 3: Batch the Analysis

Instead of calling the LLM once per pitch, you could call it:
	‚Ä¢	With the top 5 swords in one prompt
	‚Ä¢	And parse the 5 response chunks
	‚Ä¢	This minimizes outbound calls and tokens

‚∏ª

üö¶ Short-Term Patch

If you want a quick fix now, do this in Replit:
	1.	Open main.sh or your Procfile equivalent
	2.	Find the line that starts Gunicorn
	3.	Edit it like this:

gunicorn app:app --timeout 120 --workers 1

That should solve the immediate problem.
